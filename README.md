# AdSubtractor
An Apple Script meant to be used with Spotify Free. If you run it while listening to Spotify, it will mute your computer's volume as soon as an advertisement comes on. Once the ad is over, your volume will be set back to normal. 

For consistent results, run the script directly from the .scpt file. The application is faster to run, and should automatically close when you quit the Spotify application. There are some issues, though, and it occasionally glitches out when you try to close Spotify.
