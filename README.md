# AdSubtractor
An Apple Script meant to be used with Spotify Free on Mac. If you run it while listening to Spotify, it will mute your computer's volume as soon as an advertisement comes on. Once the ad is over, your volume will be set back to normal. 

You can choose to run the .scpt file from the Mac's Script Editor or directly launch the application from the .app file. The .app file is more conventient to run than the script, and should automatically close when you quit the Spotify application. If you want to make tweaks to the script (e.g. changing the time between loop iterations, removing dialog boxes, etc.), you should run the script from the .scpt file. 

If you don't like the .app file's beautiful icon, right click on it in Finder, click "show package contents", find "applet.icns" in the Resources folder, and replace it with your own .icns file. Remember to keep the file name the same, though!
